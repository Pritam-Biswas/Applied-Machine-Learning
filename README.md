# Applied-Machine-Learning
### These are collection of my Machine Learning Assignments and Term Projects Spring 2020

### **Technology stack used : Python3, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib**

The repo contains Jupyter notebooks for following tasks:
1. [**Data Visualization**](Data Visualization/Data Visualization Using Matplotlib.ipynb) - A Data Visualization notebook using Matplotlib, to show exploratory data analysis

2. **Regression and Classification pipelines** - Running regression and classification on a dataset, using numeric and categorical column transformers, Grid Search, Ridge and Lasso

3. **Regression using ensemble methods** - Running pipelines of RandomForest and XgBoost on mixed columns data, performing grid search over all hyperparameters

4. **Regression on BOW and word embeddings** - Regression on a dataset of text and numeric data , using Bag-of-Words and word2vec word embedding approaches

5. **Neural Networks in Keras** - Running grid search on Neural Net parameters, Building Deep Neural Net with Batch-Norm and dropout, Building Convolutional Neural Net with residual connections
